#+TITLE: LM's neovim configuration
#+AUTHOR: Leonardo Mascelli

* Introduction
  This is my neovim configuration. It's a kind of game to make it as more expandable and structured
  as possible but i'm not an experienced programmer so it can turn out to be a mess. Sowwy :(


* Structure
  The whole configuration is structured as a module `lm`. So the `init.lua` file just requires it.
